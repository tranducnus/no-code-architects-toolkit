/home/runner/workspace/.pythonlibs/lib/python3.12/site-packages/whisper/__init__.py:150: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

[00:00.000 --> 00:04.540]  There are three things you must never say in a job interview.
[00:05.160 --> 00:07.900]  Number one, do not say, I am nervous.
[00:08.460 --> 00:13.220]  Because if you say you are nervous, the hiring manager will think you lack the confidence
[00:13.220 --> 00:15.320]  to do your job competently.
[00:15.880 --> 00:22.220]  Number two, you should never say anything negative about your former employer, co-workers
[00:22.220 --> 00:22.840]  or boss.
[00:23.220 --> 00:28.880]  If you do say anything negative, the hiring manager might think it's you who has the problem.
[00:28.880 --> 00:33.840]  And then finally, the third thing you should never say in a job interview is that you
[00:33.840 --> 00:35.240]  are a perfectionist.
[00:35.500 --> 00:39.840]  Especially when answering the interview question, what is your biggest weakness?
[00:40.260 --> 00:45.560]  Instead, tell them that your biggest weakness is the fact that you are not very good at
[00:45.560 --> 00:46.520]  public speaking.
[00:46.820 --> 00:51.680]  But if there are any opportunities in the role to give talks to your team, you would love
[00:51.680 --> 00:52.540]  to give it a try.
