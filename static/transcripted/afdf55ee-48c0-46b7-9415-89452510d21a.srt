1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
There are three things you must never say in a job interview.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,280
Number one, do not say, I am nervous.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,560
Because if you say you are nervous, the hiring manager will think you lack the confidence

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,600
to do your job competently.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,360
Number two, you should never say anything negative about your former employer, co-workers

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
or boss.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,360
If you do say anything negative, the hiring manager might think it's you who has the problem.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,800
And then finally, the third thing you should never say in a job interview is that you

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,520
are a perfectionist.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,440
Especially when answering the interview question, what is your biggest weakness?

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,040
Instead, tell them that your biggest weakness is the fact that you are not very good at public

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
speaking.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,440
But if there are any opportunities in the role to give talks to your team, you would

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,640
love to give it a try.
